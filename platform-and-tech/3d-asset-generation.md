Buu.Fun - Getting Started
{% endembed %}

### Overview

Buu.fun is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to streamline the creation of 3D game-nearly-ready production assets. Whether you're a game developer, designer, or hobbyist, Buu.fun empowers users to generate high-quality 3D models quickly and intuitively using text prompts, images, and an array of customizable styles. With additional features like real-time Augmented Reality (AR) visualization and multiple output options, Buu.fun bridges the gap between imagination and production-ready assets.

### Key Features

#### 1. Prompt-to-3D

* **How it Works**: Simply type a description of the 3D asset you want (e.g., "a futuristic spaceship with glowing engines"). As you type, Buu.fun’s intelligent semantic suggestion engine provides real-time recommendations to refine your prompt, ensuring clarity and precision.
* **Example**: Typing "dragon" might suggest "fire-breathing dragon with scales" or "cute dragon with big eyes."
* **Benefit**: This feature accelerates the creative process by offering inspiration and reducing vague inputs, resulting in more accurate 3D models.

#### 2. Image-to-3D

* **How it Works**: Upload an image (e.g., a sketch, photo, or concept art), and Buu.fun’s AI will interpret the visual data to generate a corresponding 3D model.
* **Supported Formats**: JPG, PNG, and more.
* **Benefit**: Ideal for artists who prefer visual starting points, this feature transforms 2D ideas into fully realized 3D assets with minimal effort.

#### 3. Mobile AR Kit

* **How it Works**: Using your smartphone camera, the Buu.fun AR Kit lets you place generated 3D models into your real-world environment in real time. Adjust scale, rotation, and position to visualize how the asset fits in a physical space.
* **Example**: Place a "low poly tree" on your desk or a "sci-fi turret" in your backyard.
* **Benefit**: Perfect for prototyping game environments or showcasing designs in a tangible way.

#### 4. Style Customization

Every 3D model generated on Buu.fun can be styled using one of the following options, tailoring the asset to your project’s aesthetic:

<details>

<summary><strong>Cute</strong></summary>

Inspired by the vibrant and playful culture of Kuwait, this style features soft edges, bright colors, and whimsical details. Think adorable characters with oversized eyes, intricate patterns reminiscent of Kuwaiti architecture, and a warm, inviting feel. Ideal for family-friendly games or lighthearted designs.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Environment</strong></summary>

A diorama-like isometric style perfect for building game worlds. This features clean, angular layouts with a top-down perspective, vibrant textures, and a cohesive aesthetic inspired by classic strategy games. Great for crafting cities, forests, or dungeons.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Realistic</strong></summary>

High-definition models with lifelike textures and intricate detailing. Inspired by cutting-edge rendering techniques, this style delivers photorealistic objects like weathered stone statues or sleek modern vehicles, ready for AAA-quality games.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Low Poly</strong></summary>

A minimalist, geometric style with flat faces and sharp edges. This retro-inspired aesthetic is lightweight and optimized for performance, making it ideal for mobile games or stylized indie projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Voxel</strong></summary>

Minecraft-inspired blocky designs with a charming, pixelated look. Perfect for sandbox games or retro vibes, this style uses cubic forms to create everything from characters to sprawling landscapes.

<details>

<summary><strong>Low Poly</strong></summary>

A minimalist, geometric style with flat faces and sharp edges. This retro-inspired aesthetic is lightweight and optimized for performance, making it ideal for mobile games or stylized indie projects.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Toon</strong></summary>

A bold, cartoonish style inspired by Fortnite’s colorful and exaggerated designs. Expect vibrant hues, smooth curves, and a playful energy that pops in fast-paced or casual games.

<details>

<summary><strong>No Style</strong></summary>

A blank slate option where you define the aesthetic entirely in your prompt (e.g., "steampunk airship with brass gears"). This offers maximum creative freedom for unique or niche designs.

</details>

#### 5. Output and Iteration

* **Download**: Once a 3D model is generated, export it in the widely compatible .glb format, ready for use in game engines like Unity or Unreal Engine.
* **Retry Feature**: Not satisfied with the first result? Click "Retry" to generate three additional variations of the same prompt in parallel, giving you up to four unique models to choose from.
* **Benefit**: This iterative approach ensures you find the perfect asset without starting from scratch.

#### 6. Credit System

* **Cost**: Each 3D generation costs 1 credit.
* **Retry Cost**: Generating additional variations via "Retry" also costs 1 credit per model (up to 3 extra credits per retry).
* **Benefit**: A simple, transparent pricing model that scales with your creative needs.
