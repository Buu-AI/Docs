# Re-Mesh Technology

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Feature in Progress:** This functionality is currently in development and will be available soon. Check the [roadmap](../timeline/roadmap.md) for more details on its release timeline.
{% endhint %}

BUU.FUN integrates **AI-driven re-mesh technology** to optimize **3D assets** for real-time performance while preserving visual quality. In game development, high-poly models can be demanding on hardware, affecting frame rates and increasing memory consumption. By automating the re-meshing process, BUU.FUN ensures assets remain **lightweight, efficient, and adaptable** across different platforms, from high-end gaming PCs to mobile and VR environments.

## **The Challenge of Mesh Optimization**

Balancing **visual detail with performance efficiency** is a persistent challenge for game studios. High-poly models slow down rendering, increase load times, and create bottlenecks, especially in multiplayer environments. Traditionally, reducing polygon count requires **manual retopology, texture baking, and optimization workflows**, which are both time-intensive and require specialized expertise.

BUU.FUN eliminates this bottleneck by using **AI-powered re-meshing**, which dynamically **adjusts polygon density based on platform and rendering needs**.

## **How BUU.FUN’s AI Re-Mesh Works**

By leveraging deep learning and topology-aware processing, the system intelligently optimizes 3D models while ensuring:

* **Automatic poly reduction** – Adjusts mesh complexity based on in-game performance requirements.
* **LOD (Level of Detail) adaptation** – Generates multiple versions of an asset to dynamically change resolution based on camera distance.
* **Texture and UV preservation** – Maintains material fidelity and detail even after mesh simplification.
* **Adaptive topology for animation** – Ensures smooth deformations in rigged models, preventing animation artifacts.

## **Scalability & Future Integration**

BUU.FUN’s re-mesh system integrates directly with 3D pipelines, **offering assets in GLB, FBX, and OBJ formats**. Future updates will extend AI-driven re-mesh capabilities for **real-time optimization within game engines**, making it even more adaptive for developers.

With this technology, studios can **maintain high-quality visuals without compromising performance**, allowing them to scale their games seamlessly across different hardware platforms.
